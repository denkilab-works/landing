# Introduction

This is a sample blog post demonstrating MDX capabilities. In a real implementation, this content would come from actual MDX files stored in your project or a CMS.

## Key Points

- MDX combines the power of Markdown with JSX
- It allows embedding React components within your content
- Perfect for blog posts, documentation, and more

## Code Example

\`\`\`typescript
function greet(name: string): string \{
  return \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
}

console.log(greet('Reader'));
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

1. Replace this placeholder content with real MDX files
2. Add more styling to your blog
3. Consider adding features like comments, sharing, etc.
